We were able to implement the dispensing of cash in terms of multiples of 2000s,1000s,500s and 100s keeping in mind the restrictions given
 to us. We have also implemented a major part of caching of the users account number,pin and money details so that the user can withdraw
 money which is reflected in the backend after it is connected again. 
However we were not able to implement the ethernet communication between the boards and so have NOT USED BANK ID to differenciate between 
the banks.
